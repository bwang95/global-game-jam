{"name":"Global Game Jam 2014: We","tagline":"Central Texas Global Game Jam, January 24th-26th, 2014","body":"# _\"We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nWe is a game designed around this theme. As one of three main characters, you the player will navigate a perilous dungeon, slaying monsters and collecting various items to aid you in your quest. Rather unfortunately, the lighting is poor...\r\n\r\n## Game Objective\r\n\r\nOnce you get all three cards, find the portal and get back out! You only have three lives, so be careful!\r\n\r\n## Technical Information\r\n\r\nWe is a roguelike, procedurally generated top-down dungeon crawler for Windows, made in Unity.\r\n\r\n## Controls\r\n\r\n>* Ctrl - Use Items\r\n>* WASD - Movement\r\n>* 1, 2, 3 - Change characters once you have unlocked them\r\n>* Space - Attack; Each character has different attack and their respective enemies behave differently...Find the characters' cards to unlock them and find out what is different!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation Instructions: \r\n\r\nOpen global-game-jam/release/we.exe \r\n\r\n### Troubleshooting:\r\n\r\nIf the computer has a discrete graphics card (mainly those with Nvidia Optimus), the game may crash. To counteract this, set we.exe to run with the discrete graphics processor (for most Nvidia cards, right click on the exe and select Run with Graphics Processor -> Nvidia Processor).\r\n\r\nOn Windows 8, the game may have to be run as administrator.\r\n\r\n## The Team\r\n\r\nTeam YASC: (Yet Another Stupid Conflict)\r\n\r\n**Rachael Metcalf** (@RyotaRaven) - Art Lead, Programmer, Game Designer\r\n\r\n**Nicole Muzquiz** (@Insanity-Chu) - Music Lead, Game Designer\r\n\r\n**Ben Lin** (@CloudBreath9) - Enemy AI Programming Lead\r\n\r\n**Christopher Vernino** (@Popolo) - Unity Programming Lead, Musician\r\n\r\n**Brian Wang** (@bwang95) - Repository Manager, Programmer, Musician\r\n\r\n**Thomas Torres** - Remote Contributor: Music Lead\r\n\r\n\r\n[Global Game Jam Website](http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/we)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
